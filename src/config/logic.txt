Sample logic with minimum AI

get the topic, get the words, order in pairs of same length,
how many are there missing a pair.
send to AI to pair them with a word preferbly with topic that is the same length
return the pair and add in the array.
get the theme ask AI how they should be broken down for a 12 by 12 grid have it return it in order
and paired with word of equal lenght prioratizing each other.

pair each point with its symetric counterpart
add each word from topic and theme in the grid with all their length validations theme always accross
topic can be accross or down. 
for each entry enter the corresponding symetrical pair, if its not possible retry until it fits.
everytime you enter a word remove all of the pairs that are being occupied for the array of empty pairs
place the black spaces in the remaining available pairs based on the difficulty, with some rules about 
at the end of words and not leaving only spaces for 2 letter words. prioratize diagonal placement in the middle
after this is done, send the grid to LLM to fill in with filler words, prioratizing medical words for the topic
after that return the grid, llm needs to validate that they are all valide words accross and vertical.
